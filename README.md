# Undergraduate Web Utility

ADT (Asian Dance Team) and DT (Dance Troupe) are two of the biggest student groups at MIT. Each semester, hundreds of students audition for these groups, and exec members spend hours manually placing people into different dances. Furthermore, during the semester, each choreographer communicates with their dances differently, some using FB groups, others using email chains. Especially for dancers who are in multiple dances, this can get confusing and important announcements may get lost. Our proposed project attempts to solve both these issues, by providing a platform that will have a more efficient, automated rostering system as well as an announcement portal for more consistent communication between members.
